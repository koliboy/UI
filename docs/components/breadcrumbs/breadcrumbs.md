# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs serve as a navigational aid, assisting users in understanding their current location within a website's hierarchy. Typically displayed as a horizontal trail of links, breadcrumbs commence with a link to the homepage and sequentially list links to each preceding level of the hierarchy leading to the current page.

### Example HTML Markup

```html
<div class="breadcrumbs" bread-h-label="Home">
    <!-- automatics window.location -->
</div>
```

### Description

The provided HTML snippet demonstrates a basic structure for implementing breadcrumbs. It employs a `div` element with the class `breadcrumbs`. The attribute `bread-h-label="Home"` suggests the label "Home" for the breadcrumb link leading to the homepage. The comment `<!-- automatics window.location -->` likely indicates an automatic mechanism for determining and updating breadcrumb links based on the current page's location.
